      <h1>Russian constructivism (approx.) 1913 to 1935.</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p class="header_sub">
        In the early 1900s, several revolutionary directions in art and design
        began, for later to develop into modernism, which today we know so well
        from the majority of the design we surround ourselves with within our
        everyday lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at that time there were thoughts that art should not be reserved for
        the upper class. That art can be constructed, abstract, without
        ornaments, new and provocative – and for the people.
      </p>

      <h2>Header Text</h2>

      <p>
        One might argue that Russia first came up with the new modernist ideas.
        Russian futurism served as the basis for the new art form. It initially
        led to Russian constructivism and later to <cite>'De Stijl'</cite> and
        <cite>'Bauhaus'</cite> in the West. <dfn>Bauhaus</dfn> is today
        considered to be the cradle of modernism.
      </p>

      <h2>Header Text</h2>

      <p>
        Within constructivism this meant that, in essence, the expressive
        personal touch was rejected, looking away from the illustrative and
        hand-made expressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        One sought a pure and universal expression. Ie. ornaments were removed
        from the design and they saw the simple geometric shapes as an objective
        reality in itself. It was created by the Russian avant-garde but quickly
        spread to the entire continent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Constructivism influenced architecture, poetry, music, and even the
        consumer market and became the new everyday life in Russia of the time.
        In the mid-1930s the end of Russian constructivism began when Stalin
        ordered art to be realistic and not abstract, ie. the opposite of
        constructivism's foundations and ideas, which were instead replaced by
        socialist realism.

      <p>
        El Lissitzky (<time>1890-1941</time>) is one of the most influential and
        famous designers of the period. He uses primary colours and geometric
        shapes in the belief that this would be the new universal visual
        language that would be understood by everyone.

        "One of our utopian ideas is the desire to overcome the limitations of
        the substructure, of the earthbound. We have developed this idea in a
        series of proposals. [...] The idea of the conquest of the substructure,
        the earthbound, can be extended even further and calls for the conquest
        of gravity as such. It demands floating structures, a physical-dynamic
        architecture."

        Lissitzky saw the square as the source of all creative unfolding. He is
        especially known for his famous propaganda poster:
        <cite>"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge"</cite> where a red triangle,
        symbolizing the Communist rebel movements, pierces a white circle that
        would symbolize the Bolsheviks.

        A poster that would encourage the people to revolution against the
        ruling regime. A revolution that came later, that today we denote 'The
        Russian Revolution'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lissitzky later traveled to the West, where he moved the constructivist
        ideals into the art group <cite>'De Stijl'</cite>.

      <p>
        Alexander Rodchenko (<time>1891-1956</time>) is another famous artist in
        Russian constructivism. He started his career painting, then he worked
        with graphic design, and later he worked with photography.
      </p>

      <p>
        His photographs were socially engaged and innovative. He often shot his
        photos from an unusual angle – high above or below to shock the viewer.
        He wrote:
      </p>

      <q>
        One has to take several different shots of a subject, from different
        points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in the
        round rather than looked through the same keyhole again and again.
      </q>

      <p>
        In his work on graphic design, he sought the unambiguous universal form.
        His work is characterized by its dynamics and energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gustav Klutsis (<time>1895–1938</time>) is claimed to together with
        Hannah Höch, Raoul Hausmann and El Lissitzky to have created the
        subgenre <cite>'Political photomontage'</cite>. A subgenre that
        originated in 1918. The ongoing theme in his works is propaganda and
        revolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        His first remarkable piece of work was a series of removable kiosks that
        were installed on the streets of Moscow in <time>1922</time>. The kiosks
        were equipped with radio speakers, screens showing movies, and
        newspapers. The installation should mark the 5th anniversary of the
        Russian Revolution.

      <p>
        The typefaces of Russian constructivism are typically geometric, clean,
        and straight forms. Ie. within the classification, it will typically be
        a sans serif: no feet, ornaments, or swung curves and no contrasts in
        the line, which means that the line has the same thickness throughout
        the letter. Headings can be crooked in an often diagonal expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        One sought for a universal and pure expression, where all ornaments were
        removed. Clean colours - and especially the primary colours - were to be
        preferred.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Russian constructivism, we especially see the red colours which
        became a symbol of the people's revolution. In addition, black and
        white, where the white is not a pure white but a cracked white, since it
        did not print the white colour but let the paper shine through.
      </p>

      <p>
        The paper was not bleached white as we know it today but was more like a
        cracked white we know from ie. natural paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were often only two colours in a design used together with the
        black and chapped white. Strong graphic layout, simple and powerful in
        their expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        The layout can be both static in its structure ie. almost symmetrical or
        have dynamic and diagonal compositions. Sharp and geometric shapes
        characterize the design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Illustrations are not used in Russian constructivism, but on the other
        hand, photographs are used as a collage element. Posters often have
        strong messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The street artist <cite>Shepard Fairey</cite> and the band
        <cite>Franz Ferdinand</cite> are some of the contemporary artists who
        have clear and direct references to Russian Constructivism in their
        visual arts.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the term in today's context receives a different content and message
        than the highly propagandist and revolutionary message it had at that
        time of its origin.
